# Programmers-Unleashed

An easy-to-use progressive web app that allows the user to add different medications, track when they've taken them, and receive reminders when the next dose is due.

## User Story

As a user I want to be able to add one or more medications to the website, inputing the required precription and utilizing the option to add a reminder or not .<br>
Once I adds the medication, it should be stored on my profile and when I click on my profile, I will be able to see all my stored medications.<br>
I want to log in to my account and have the website remember my saved medications.<br>

## Acceptance Criteria

When I click on the login button<br>
Then I am presented with a page for me to register my login details such as email address and password in order to grant me access to the website<br>
When I log in<br>
Then I am presented with my profile page containing a form to fill in my medication details<br>
When I fill in the form and click the 'Add Medication' button<br>
Then the medication I filled in is saved below the form<br>
When I click on the website logo<br>
Then I am taken to the homepage which displays all the medications which i have saved and also a calendar for the purpose of checking your medication history based on dates<br>
When I look at the website from multiple browsers<br>
Then I am presented with a responsive UI that looks good on all devices<br>
