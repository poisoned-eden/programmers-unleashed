## Usage
When the user opens this application, they are first presented with the Sign up page. This contains a navigation bar at the top of the page with links to 'Login' & ‘Signup’ and a Sign Up form for the user to register their desired login details. When the user has finished registering their details and clicks the submit button. The user is redirected to the profile page which contains another form containing details of the medication and the option to input prescription details. 
When the priscription details are added, the medication is then added to the side of the form on the profile page and also beneath the animated logo on main homepage. If the user already has an account, they can login by entering their email address and correct password and select login; if the user enters the wrong username or password, they will be alerted that they have failed to login. When login is successful, then  the user will be redirected to the profile page.
