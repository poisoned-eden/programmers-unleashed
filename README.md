# Programmers-Unleashed

An easy-to-use progressive web app that allows the user to add different medications, track when they've taken them, and receive reminders when the next dose is due.

## User Story

As a user I want to be able to add one or more medications to the website, inputing the required precription and utilizing the option to add a reminder or not .<br>
Once one adds the medication, it should be stored on one's profile and when I click on my profile, I will be able to see all my stored medications.<br>
I want to log in to my account and have the website remember my saved medications.<br>

## Acceptance Criteria

When I click on the login button<br>
Then I am presented with a page for me to register my login details such as email address and password in order to grant me access to the website<br>
When I log in<br>
Then I am presented with my profile page containing a form to fill in my medication details<br>
When I fill in the form and click the 'Add Medication' button<br>
Then the medication I filled in is saved to the right of the form<br>
When I click on the website logo<br>
Then I am taken to the homepage which displays all the medications which i have saved<br>
When I look at the website from multiple browsers<br>

## Usage
When the user opens this application, they are first presented with the Sign up page. This contains a navigation bar at the top of the page with links to 'Login' & ‘Signup’ and a Sign Up form for the user to register their desired login details. When the user has finished registering their details and clicks the submit button. The user is redirected to the profile page which contains another form containing details of the medication and the option to input prescription details. 
When the priscription details are added, the medication is then added to the side of the form on the profile page and also beneath the animated logo on main homepage. If the user already has an account, they can login by entering their email address and correct password and select login; if the user enters the wrong username or password, they will be alerted that they have failed to login. When login is successful, then  the user will be redirected to the profile page.
